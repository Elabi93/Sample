 <title>ForgeRock OpenICF Release Levels</title>

 <para>
  ForgeRock OpenICF defines API, Minor, and Maintenance product release levels.

  The release level is reflected in the version number.

  The release level tells you what sort of compatibility changes to expect.
 </para>
 
 <variablelist>

  <varlistentry>
   <term>API (version: x.x.0.0)</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     API releases bring big new features.

     API releases include changes to Stable interfaces.

     Major releases can remove previously Deprecated functionality,
     and in rare cases remove Evolving functionality
     that has not been explicitly Deprecated.

     Major releases also include the changes present
     in previous Minor and Maintenance releases.

  <varlistentry>
   <term>Minor (version: x.x.y.0)</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Minor releases might include new features,
     backwards-compatible changes to Stable interfaces in the same Major release,
     and incompatible changes to Evolving interfaces.

     Minor releases can remove previously Deprecated functionality.

     Minor releases also include the changes present in Maintenance releases.

  <varlistentry>
   <term>Maintenance (version: x.x.y.z)</term>
   <listitem>
